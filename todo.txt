    Application needs flag to start the master server
    Application needs flag for default key, if input file is given

Store:
    Dataframe - Change row to not own its data, make sure this doesn't break something
    Serialize - need types, generic deserialize method?

m3:
    1) Update column/rows serialization to include missings
    2) New DistributedDataFrame class
       - above current DF class
       - list of keys to the individual chunks, each of which are a dataframe
       - serialization methods
            -  remove semicolons to not mess up Network layer
    3) Network - need put, get, getandwait for other nodes
               - thread syncing?
               - waitAndNotify?
    4) Dataframe - ::fromArray/fromScalar defined on DistributedDataFrame?
    5) Update sorer to work with new DistributedDataFrame
    6) waitAndNotify for loops

Questions:
    DistributedArrays?
