Client:
    Sorer current starts at row 1 always, discarding first row
    Expand the example to use the dataframe after it is created
    Make sorer return a distributed DF, get rid of distribute_data

Store:
    Dataframe - Change row to not own its data, make sure this doesn't break something
    Serialize - need types, generic deserialize method?

m3:
    New DistributedDataFrame class
       - above current DF class
       - list of keys to the individual chunks, each of which are a dataframe
       - serialization methods
    Dataframe - ::fromArray/fromScalar
    Update exisiting DF to support missings with a bitmap
        - this also needs serialization updates
    Update columns' memory stuff with internal Arrays
    Network - need put, get, getandwait for other nodes

Questions:
    Network - who starts the master server?
