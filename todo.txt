    Dataframe - Change row to not own its data, make sure this doesn't break something
    Serialize - need types, generic deserialize method?

m3:
    1) Update exisiting DF to support missings with a bitmap (need missings in row and column)
        - this also needs serialization updates
    2) Update columns' memory stuff with internal Arrays
    3) New DistributedDataFrame class
       - above current DF class
       - list of keys to the individual chunks, each of which are a dataframe
       - serialization methods
    3.5) Network - need put, get, getandwait for other nodes
    4) Update sorer to work with new DistributedDataFrame
    5) Dataframe - ::fromArray/fromScalar defined on DistributedDataFrame?

Questions:
    Network - who starts the master server?
